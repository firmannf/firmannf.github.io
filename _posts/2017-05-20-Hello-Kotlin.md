### Kotlin ?
By the way I'm hearing about Kotlin at the end of 2016. I just saw a sample code from <a href="https://github.com/budioktaviyan/kotlin-android" target="_blank">Budi Oktaviyan's GitHub repository</a>. I'm not interested enough to trying Kotlin, because I just can't move on from Java that time. <!-- more --> I just know that Kotlin can be used for android development, that's all. And... this week, in Google I/O 2017, Google announced that they will officially support Kotlin for android development and it change my mind to trying Kotlin.

### Try Kotlin for The First Time
In the other dimension, Android Studio 3.0 released in canary channel that support Kotlin language without installing Kotlin plugin again. I'm using it for my first ever android app that using Kotlin. I just make a simple app that contains a button to show a toast LOL. You can visit my GitHub repository to check <a href="https://github.com/firmannf/try-android-hello-kotlin" target="_blank">the project</a>. After successfully creating the project, I compare the code for showing a toast beetween Kotlin and Java.

#### Kotlin

#### Java

The kotlin code is more concise than the Java code and I think the kotlin code is more clear and pretty. That's a nice one. Because my curiosity increased, I search for other resources to learn more Kotlin and I find a good news that Kotlin is work seamlessly with Java. Here is the statement from the <a hred="https://developer.android.com/kotlin/faq.html" target="_blank">FAQ page</a>.

> It works with the Java language seamlessly, so it makes it easy for developers who love the Java language to keep using it but also incrementally add Kotlin code and leverage Kotlin libraries.

I decide to learn more about Kotlin because I think it will be fun. `Nice to meet you` Kotlin!
