### My Story
in recent weeks, I've been researching about MVP pattern in android. In the past, I always put all code in the activity and I just realized it's not good for future development, so I decide to learn MVP pattern. I found a good resource from **Google Samples** on github <!-- more --> <a href="https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp/" target="_blank">`https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture/tree/todo-mvp/`</a>. For future use, I decide to build a template based on that **Google Samples**, so I'm learning how to build an android studio template. After some night surfing the internet, I found a good sample, here it is <a href="https://github.com/sudargits/MVPTemplate" target="_blank">`https://github.com/sudargits/MVPTemplate`</a>.

### The Template
After some hours, the template is successfully created, you can visit <a href="https://github.com/firmannf/cl-android-mvp-template" target="_blank">`https://github.com/firmannf/cl-android-mvp-template`</a> to see my template. If you're interested to use this template, you just do this 3 steps :

* Clone the repo
* Copy the `MVPActivity` folder to the `{Android Studio Directory}\plugins\android\lib\templates\activities\`
* Restart `Android Studio` if you are opening it
